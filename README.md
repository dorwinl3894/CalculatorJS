# CalculatorJS
Basic Calculator made with JavaScript that can add, subtract, multiple, and divide whole numbers

### This is the first project I ever made with Javascript. This project has helped expose me to Javascript and how it can be used with HTML to create user input information.

### HTML,CSS, Javascript made in January 2019
### Media Query added February 2019
